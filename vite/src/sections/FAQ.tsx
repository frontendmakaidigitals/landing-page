        "We only ever onboard clients when it is a no brainer we can help. If we don't truly believe we can help you after going through a deep diagnosis of your business then we will simply part ways and not waste anymore of each other's time. And thatâ€™s why the guarantee!",

        "You can start seeing results from 1-2 weeks from your first campaign.",

      question: "How do you make sure that we are being taken care of?",
